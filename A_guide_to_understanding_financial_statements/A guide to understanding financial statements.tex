\subsection{What are financial statements?}
\textbf{Definition:} Financial statements are like lab results for your company's financial health, showing income, assets, and liabilities.\\
\textbf{Types of Statements:} The three main financial statements are:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Profit and Loss Statement: Details income and expenses, showing profitability.
\item Balance Sheet: Shows assets, liabilities, and owners' equity at a specific point in time.
\item Statement of Cash Flows: Tracks cash movements through operating, investing, and financing activities.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Accounting Methods:}  The video introduces cash basis and accrual basis accounting, which will be explored further.

\subsection{Cash vs. accrual}
\textbf{Cash Basis:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Records transactions when cash is received or paid.
\item Simpler and provides a real-time view of cash flow.
\item Not compliant with GAAP, and may not fully reflect business activities.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Accrual Basis:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Records transactions when income is earned and expenses are incurred.
\item More complex but provides a more accurate picture of financial health.
\item Compliant with GAAP and used by larger businesses with outside investors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GAAP vs. IFRS}
\textbf{Definitions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles): Common in the United States, especially for public companies.
\item IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards): A unified standard used globally.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Usage:}
\begin{itemize}
\item GAAP is developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and is mandatory for U.S. public companies.
\item IFRS is developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and is used internationally.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Accounting Basis:}
\begin{itemize}
\item GAAP does not accept the cash basis of accounting and requires the accrual basis.
\item Both standards provide a rule book for recognizing transactions, ensuring reliability in financial statements.
\end{itemize}
