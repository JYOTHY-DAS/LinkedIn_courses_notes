\section{Understanding Cloud Service Models}

%%%%%%%
\subsection{What is cloud computing}
\textbf{Definition:}  Cloud computing is the delivery of any computing resources from the IT stack as a service by a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).\\
\textbf{Characteristics:}  Cloud computing allows for the seamless blending and fragmentation of computing resources, providing an almost infinite amount of resources for provisioning.\\
\textbf{Benefits:}  It eliminates the need for businesses to build and maintain their own IT stack, offering computing resources as a service, similar to ordering a cake from a confectionary store instead of baking it yourself.

%%%%%%%
\subsection{Virtualization is the foundation for cloud}
\textbf{Virtualization Technology:}  Virtualization is the core foundation of cloud computing, enabling the creation of software copies of physical components like processors, memory, and hard disks.\\
\textbf{Mobility and Provisioning:}  These virtual components can be provisioned over the internet or any network, allowing them to function like real physical components but with greater flexibility and mobility.\\
\textbf{Isolation:}  Virtualization provides isolation between instances of virtualized resources, ensuring they operate independently and are unaware of other virtualized resources on the system.

%%%%%%%
\subsection{Key characteristics of cloud computing}
\textbf{Resource Pooling:}  Combining multiple physical computing resources into a large pool of virtualized resources that can be provisioned as needed.\\
\textbf{Elasticity:}  The ability to provision and deprovision resources as demand fluctuates, thanks to the vast capacity of cloud service providers.\\
\textbf{Pay Per Use:}  Only paying for the resources you use and the time you use them for, eliminating the need for large upfront investments in hardware.\\
\textbf{Automation:}  Automated processes for resource pooling, elasticity, and pay-per-use billing, enabling on-demand provisioning and self-service without relying on technical support.

%%%%%%%
\subsection{Understand infrastructure as a service (IaaS)}
\textbf{Definition:}  IaaS provides customers with access to virtualized hardware resources, such as servers, storage, and networking.\\
\textbf{Control and Customization:}  Customers have control over the operating system, patches, applications, and data, allowing for high customization.\\
\textbf{Provider Responsibilities:}  The cloud service provider handles the physical hardware, including power, cooling, and internet connections, while customers manage everything above the hardware level.

%%%%%%%
\subsection{Understand platform as a service (PaaS)}
\textbf{Definition:}  PaaS provides customers with access to application dependencies like frameworks and runtime, managed by the cloud service provider.\\
\textbf{Benefits:}  Customers can quickly get their applications up and running without dealing with underlying configurations, as the provider handles the operating system, patches, and hotfixes.\\
\textbf{Considerations:}  While PaaS offers ease of use and quick setup, it provides less control over the environment compared to IaaS. Most applications run well on PaaS, making it a popular choice among businesses.
