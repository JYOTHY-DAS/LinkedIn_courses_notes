# 📚 LinkedIn Course Notes Repository

This repository contains well-organized **LaTeX files** and **PDF notes** from various courses I have completed on LinkedIn. The goal of this repository is to maintain structured, high-quality notes that can be easily referenced and shared.

## 📝 Contents
The repository includes:
- LaTeX source files for each course.
- Compiled PDFs for easy reading.
- Notes covering key concepts, important takeaways, and practical applications.

## 📂 Structure
Each course has its own dedicated folder with the following format:

```plaintext
📁 Course_Name/
   ├── Course_name.tex         # LaTeX source file
   ├── Course_name.pdf         # Compiled PDF file
   ├── Course_name.synctex.gz  # SyncTeX file for editor synchronization
   ├── references/       # Any additional resources (if applicable)

## 🔧 How to Use
1. **Read the PDFs** directly if you just want the notes.
2. **Modify the LaTeX files** if you wish to customize the notes or format them differently.
3. **Compile the `.tex` files** using a LaTeX editor such as Overleaf, TeXworks, or VS Code with LaTeX extensions.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Expand the collection by adding notes from more LinkedIn courses.
- Improve formatting for better readability.
- Include practical examples and code snippets where applicable.
